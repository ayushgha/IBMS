# Intelligent Blood Management System
This Application presents an efficient method for a smart blood management system, called Intelligent Blood Management System (IBMS) that intends to provide efficient and real-time coordination of blood management within a blood bank as well as to establish great communication amongst multiple blood banks. This system uses a unique and an economic concept of using the weight detecting sensors along with image processing that can efficiently track the quantity of the different blood groups (using colour coding mechanism) in all the associated blood banks, using Cloud connectivity. It uses an internal management analytic that always takes care of the availability of blood and using predetermined logic that can pre-populate a blood bank based on the highest frequency of the need of certain blood in an area.
This system has an integration of user interaction also, where users and even hospitals can make requests for blood through the app (including app verification). The mobile application helps users to connect with the system including the fastest way to reach the blood bank and even live to track if the blood is to be delivered from the bank to the hospital and more.
